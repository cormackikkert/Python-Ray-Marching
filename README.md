# Python-Ray-Marching
ray marching in GLSL with a python GUI.
You can change the slides to change the fractal paramters and use arrow keys to move around the scene.
This was just a project I did for fun to experiment with distance estimators, so the UX is horrible and the code is hacky.

Due to the power of ray marching a suprisingly high frame rate is achieved.
